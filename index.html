      <br>
      
      <h2><b><center>Due to high demand, more tickets have been opened up for our launch day on August 10th!</center></b></h2>

      <br><br>

      <h2><b>What is Wellness Explorers?</b></h2>

      <h3 id="contactMeText">
        <br>
        <p>Wellness Explorers is a summer initiative founded by McMaster medical students for the Hamilton population in collaboration with <b>Nature at McMaster, Bruce Trails, McMaster Children and Youth University, McMaster Department of Athletics and Recreation, and Woodcraft Canada!</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>Our mission is to champion equitable access to the outdoors for all school-aged children in Hamilton while empowering them to prioritize their wellbeing. Our program is dedicated to fostering a love for the outdoors. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Each of our weekend events consists of an exciting 1.5 hour guided hike. During the hike, participants (whom we call Explorers!) and their families will be led by McMaster medical student guides. During the hike, we will stop periodically for educational stations focusing on preventative health (e.g. sun safety, bug bite safety, physical activity, nutrition, etc.) On some of our Iroquoia Heights hikes, we will also be accompanied by a volunteer guide from Bruce Trails who will teach participants about the ecology of the trail we are on. <b>Did we mention that each participant will receive an Explorer Bag consisting of granola bars, sunscreens, moisturizers, stickers, and more?</b></p>
    <br>
      <h2><b>Where is the event?</b></h2>
      <br>
      <p><b>This year, we are offering our program at two locations: Iroquoia Heights and Bayfront Park!</b> If you are more interested in a traditional hiking trail and want to learn more about the ecology of the land we live on, come join us at Iroquoia Heights! We'd love to see you at our launch on August 10th. If you are looking for an easier walk at an accessible location, come join us at Bayfront Park. There's something for everyone!</p>
      <br>

      <h2><b>Our Program is Completely Free!</b></h2>
      <br>
      <p>Our program is completely free thanks to our generous sponsors! Our events are sponsored by <b>Bioderma, Burt's Bees, L'Or√©al, Ontario Medical Student Association and the McMaster Alumni Association!</b></p>
<br><br>
      <h2><b>Who's the target audience for this initiative?</b></h2>
      <br>
      <p>The target age range for these hikes is 6-12 years of age, but we welcome explorers of all ages! We also encourage Explorers to sign up with their families, as Wellness Explorers is best experienced as a family event! </p>
      <br>
